### Required Libraries

Black Rook Commons 2.15.0+  
[https://github.com/BlackRookSoftware/Common](https://github.com/BlackRookSoftware/Common)

### Introduction

This library contains classes that aid in database querying and connection
pooling, two of the most tedious things to do with SQL databases. Queried rows
can be returned as specialized maps or POJOs with their values set via 
reflection.

This also contains support for some popular NoSQL servers. 

### Library

Contained in this release is a series of classes used for database querying, 
SQL database connection pooling, and other SQL-related tasks. The javadocs 
contain basic outlines of each package's contents plus class documentation.

This also contains a Redis client for interfacing with the Key-Value store,
[http:/redis.io/](Redis).
