can be returned as specialized maps or POJOs with their values set via 
reflection.

==== Library

Contained in this release is a series of classes used for database querying, 
SQL database connection pooling, and other SQL-related tasks. The javadocs 
contain basic outlines of each package's contents plus class documentation.
